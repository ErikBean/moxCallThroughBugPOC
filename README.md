Project cloned from : https://github.com/angular/angular-seed

POC for a feature request/ bug fix for this project: https://github.com/fvanwijk/mox
This feature has now been merged into mox 0.5.0: https://github.com/fvanwijk/mox/releases/tag/v0.5.0
So this POC no longer proves any defect with mox, just keeping it around as a reference

1. download node and npm: https://nodejs.org/download/
2. clone this repo
3. switch to project dir
4. npm install
5. npm  test
6. See that the 4th test fails. This is the test for and.callThrough() using mox
